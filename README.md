## Instructions

We are on a quest! The supreme leader's precious and powerful gems were stolen! Luckily, the thief left a clue on where he buried the gems. The supreme leader gave you 20 lives and it is your task to collect 'em all!

There should be three places in where you can excavate the gems. But the gems are guarded with determined and undetermined mines. You should avoid them to preserve your lives.
